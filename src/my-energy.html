    <h1>Energy</h1>
  </div>
         
    <p>First Payment offers a range of ways to save money when it comes to energy costs whether it's gas, electricity or both. We guarantee our customers the lowest rates, in fact if you find cheaper anywhere else we’ll match the price.</p>
        
    <p>We know that no two companies have the same energy needs, which is why we tailor an individual quote to suit your business. Let one of our account Managers compare prices, tariffs, contracts so you can get on with running your business.</p>
        
    <p>By allowing us to manage your energy contracts, you can avoid price rises, be sure of the cheapest rates at all times, make consistent savings and free up your time.</p>
    
    <p>Grouping all your requirements under one umbrella is not only simpler, it's often the most cost effective solution. Alternatively, our fixed energy deal provides complete budget certainty so there are no worries, no unexpected bills.</p>

    <p>Call one of the First Payment Finance team today to help you choose the contract that’s best for your business.</p>
