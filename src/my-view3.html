    <h1>Energy</h1>
  </div>
         
    <p>First Payment offers a range of great ways to save money when it comes to your energy costs whether it's gas, electricity or both. We guarantee our customers the lowest rates, in fact if you find cheaper anywhere else we’ll match the price.</p>
        
    <p>No two companies have the same energy needs, which is why we tailor an individual quote to suit your business. We're well aware of the complexities of switching providers; comparing prices, the range of tariffs, different contracts, so let one of our Account Managers do all the hard work.</p>
        
    <p>By allowing us to manage your energy contracts, you can avoid price rises, be sure of the cheapest rates at all times, make consistent savings and free up your time.</p>
    
    <p>Grouping all your requirements under one umbrella is not only simpler, it's often the most cost effective solution. Another of our options is the fixed energy deal, with complete budget certainty there are no worries about unexpected bills.</p>

    <p>Call one of the First Payment Finance team today to help you choose the contract that’s best for your business.<p/>
