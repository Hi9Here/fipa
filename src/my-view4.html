    <p>Rather than a loan, we offer unsecured funding by purchasing a portion of your future card sales.    
    This smarter money management provides flexibility not only catering for your existing requirements but for your future needs. This means you can scale your business your way. And because you're not tied to any fixed amount, you repay less when things are slow and more when business is flourishing.</p>
    
    <p>Eligibility is simple; based on your card sales history, your business can access finance equalling its average monthly turnover of credit card transactions. And unsecured funding means you wonâ€™t need to use an asset such as a property to secure against borrowing.</p>
    
    <p>There are no interest charges, no hidden fees, no need for a perfect credit score and because it's not a loan your credit score will not be affected.</p>
    
    <p>75% of all applications are successful and a pre-approved decision is made on average in 24hrs.</p>
